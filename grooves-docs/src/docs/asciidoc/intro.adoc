== Introduction

Event Sourcing is a way of storing data for flexible retrieval.
The principle behind Event Sourcing is very simple.
We treat our database like a log file.
It is a record of everything that happened as events, and we read these events in order to compute the state of things like we do while debugging an application from the logs.

=== Event Sourcing Concepts

Here are some things that we will need to get familiar with, that are relevant to Event Sourcing.

==== Aggregate

An aggregate is a type of object that you are interested in managing data about.
A classic example would be a bank account.

==== Event

An event is an atomic change that needs to occur on the aggregate.
A suitable example for the bank account would be a transaction.
It could be an ATM withdrawal, or a check deposit, or an electronic payment.
Most events can be applied while only looking ahead.
When there is a `revert` event or a `merge` (which is represented as a `deprecates` and a `deprecatedBy` events), that doesn't hold true.

We will not be modifying the aggregate in our data store.
We will however, store the event in the data store so we know when we read to read it a certain way.

==== Snapshot

A snapshot is a way of looking at the state of an aggregate at a point in time.
In our banking example, this could be your account balance.

=== CQRS

Event Sourcing works particularly well with CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation.
There are a couple of types of objects that are relevant to Event Sourcing and CQRS.

==== Command
A command is an input which causes one or more events to be stored.
It typically represents a broad intention of the user.

==== Query
A query is a computation that needs to be performed in order to obtain a snapshot.

A query performs a computation like the one below.

[stem]
++++
S_N = f(S_0, [E_1 .. E_(N)])
++++

Where

* stem:[S_N] is the Snapshot computed by applying the first `N` events.
* stem:[S_0] is the empty snapshot.

Most of the time this also holds true

[stem]
++++
S_N = f(S_k, [E_(k+1) .. E_(N)])
++++

The second one holds true only for forward events.

=== Representing Events

This is how we'll be representing events in the documentation.

[esdiag,SimpleEvents]
....
|Type,ID,Description
  + 1 2016-01-02 created as John Lennon
  + 2 2016-01-03 performed FLUSHOT for $ 32.40
  + 3 2016-01-04 performed GLUCOSETEST for $ 78.93
  + 4 2016-01-05 paid $ 100.25
....

The aggregate is represented by the rectangle.
It says its type and its id in the box.
Above the box is a description of the aggregate.

The circles with numbers represent events that are applied on the aggregate.
They are reasonably spaced apart to show the flow of time.
The spacing is not necessarily linear.
However when there are multiple aggregates shown together, the time lines will be in sync.

Creation events will have a dotted circle around them.
It doesn't mean anything special.

[esdiag,ParallelEvents]

|Patient,1,John Lennon
  + 1 2016-01-02 created as John Lennon
  + 2 2016-01-03 performed FLUSHOT for $ 32.40
  + 3 2016-01-04 performed GLUCOSETEST for $ 78.93
  + 4 2016-01-08 paid $ 100.25
  + 5 2016-01-19 paid $ 100.25
|Patient,1,Ringo Starr
  + 1 2016-01-10 created as Ringo Starr
  + 2 2016-01-11 performed FLUSHOT for $ 32.40
  + 3 2016-01-12 performed GLUCOSETEST for $ 78.93
  + 4 2016-01-19 paid $ 100.25
....

When the time of two events is exactly the same, then they are displayed like this.
