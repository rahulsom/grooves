=== Snapshots

Let's start with a snapshot that manages account balance for a patient.

<1> For most snapshots, you may implement `Snapshot`.
<2> The `lastEventPosition` is useful when locating snapshots by version.
<3> The `lastEventTimestamp` is useful when locating snapshots by timestamp.
<4> The `aggregateObservable` getter points to the aggregate from the snapshot.
<5> The `deprecatedByObservable` points to the deprecator of the snapshot's aggregate.
  It is empty when the aggregate is not deprecated.
<6> The `deprecatesObservable` points to the aggregates deprecated by snapshot's aggregate.

The reason for `aggregateObservable`, `deprecatedByObservable` and `deprecatesObservable` being `rx.Observable` is to allow asynchronous data access layers to work well.

In our examples, we have one more snapshot - `PatientHealth` which lists codes for procedures and the dates they were performed.
