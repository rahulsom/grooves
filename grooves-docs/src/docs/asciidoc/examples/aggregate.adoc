=== Aggregates

In our examples, to begin with, we will use one aggregate - a patient.
We'll model our system such that there are events that get applied on a Patient's timeline.

To uniquely identify a patient, we're assuming, all we need is a `uniqueId`.
No name, no address, no other information.

The rest of the information will be brought in using events.

<1> This annotation will assist in checking for completeness of queries.
  There are two other annotations we'll see - `@Event` and `@Query`.
  Together, the three will help us ensure that our queries cover all events.
  This is optional, but highly recommended.

<2> For grooves to use an aggregate, you must implement the `GormAggregate` interface.
  It accepts a type using generics that identifies the `id` of the aggregate.
  That is typically used as the primary key in a database.
<3> This is commented out, because it is implicit in grails with a type of `Long`.
  If it is implicit for your codebase, you do not have to declare it.

<1> Since 0.5.0, there isn't really anything special to do for declaring Aggregates.
