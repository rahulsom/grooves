Next up, let's look at our first event, `PatientCreated`.

[source,java,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Java

<1> The `@Event` annotation is the second step to achieving completeness of events.
  It accepts as a param, the Aggregate over which it applies.
<2> For most events you're interested in as a user, you'll just have to extend `PatientEvent`.

[source,groovy,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/examples/grooves-example-springboot/grooves-example-springboot-jpa/src/main/groovy/grooves/boot/jpa/domain/PatientEvent.groovy[tags=created]

[source,kotlin,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
sealed class PatientEvent : BaseEvent<...> {
    // ... skipping stuff already there ...
include::{sourcedir}/examples/grooves-example-springboot/grooves-example-springboot-kotlin/src/main/kotlin/grooves/boot/kotlin/domain/PatientEvent.kt[tags=created]
}
----
<1> First we create a sealed class within the `PatientEvent` called `Applicable`.
  What we call it doesn't matter.
  All application events will go there.
<2> For most events you're interested in as a user, you'll just have to extend `Applicable`.

In our example, we'll have two more business events.

* `ProcedurePerformed` that gives you a procedure code and the cost
* `PaymentMade` which gives you the amount paid

Please look at the source to see how they are implemented.
