= Events

In our example, we're going to have a bunch of events that will modify the computed state of the `Patient`.

== Your Base Event
include::baseEvent.adoc[]

== Your business events
include::creationEvent.adoc[]

== Standard Grooves Events
There are some Standard Grooves Events - JoinEvent, DisjoinEvent, DeprecatedBy, Deprecates, RevertEvent.
Their implementation is similar to one another, but slightly different from your business events.
