Let's start with the PatientEvent first.
`PatientEvent` is the base event for all events related to `Patient`.

<1> You'll have to extend `BaseEvent`.
<2> This is typically transient from a persistence perspective.
  Since we're using collections for persistence, it doesn't make much difference.
<3> Timestamp is used for time based filtering and ordering
<4> Position is used for version based filtering and ordering.
<5> The aggregate observable allows for lazy fetching of the aggregate.
  Again, since we're using collections, it doesn't matter.

  In our case, it doesn't matter much since we're using JPA, which is blocking in nature.

<1> We're using sealed classes in Kotlin.
  We'll add more classes inside of it as we progress.
  This helps us achieve completeness without the need to customize the compilation.
