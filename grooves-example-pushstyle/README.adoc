= Push Style

Demonstrates Push Style Event Sourcing using Grooves.

== Getting Started

- A good starting point to understand this example would be looking at `PushTest.kt`.
- `ContextManager` and `ContextAwareScheduler` together help carry data correctly through RxJava's threads.
- `EventService` defines `query` in a way that does not require defining classes.

Looking at these things should help you design your own solution based on Push.
While this is purely push based, you can create a system that uses push when possible, and resorts to pull when necessary.
